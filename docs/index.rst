Welcome to the py-smps docs!
============================

`py-smps` is an open-source python package to help analyze and visualize
size-resolved aerosol data of any kind. These instruments may include the 
Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Scanning Electrical Mobility 
Analyzer (SEMS), Grimm 11-D Dust Decoder, and more! While most of the 
existing analysis software for aerosol data is either proprietary or one-off 
scripts written by individual researchers/labs, here, we offer a single solution 
that can be used for any size-resolved aerosol data whether it is from a $75k SMPS 
or a $400 low-cost optical particle counter.

The python package is currently maintained by QuantAQ, Inc. and is available for use under 
the MIT license. 

`py-smps` makes analyzing size-resolved particle data easy, regardless 
of the type of analyzer used.
