Welcome! We're happy to see you're willing to make the project better. Have you read the entire
user documentation yet?

Development for `py-smps` currently focuses on Python3.8 through Python3.12. If you would like to 
add support for a more recent version (e.g., python4.x), please open a discussion topic on the
`project board <https://github.com/quant-aq/py-smps/discussions>`_.
